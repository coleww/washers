# washers

A "washer" is an iframe centered in a browser window,

with a div absolutely positioned on top of it,

and some javascript or css or whatever stuff in that div.

### lol

"watchers" ... get it? i don't. it just came to me.

a watcher is just an html file. it depends on the internet,

but there are no other local dependencies besides having a web browser

### some examples:

### scaffold new washers with unix!

    cp TEMPLATE.html new_washer_name.html

### contribute!

if you think this sounds like fun, fork it or open an issue or make a pull request and so on

### TODO

    figure out git flow?
        KEEP just template, fake index, and readme on master.
        each washer-er forks the repo,
        git clones master,
        checks out a clean gh-pages based on master,
        and then pushes with force to their fork,
        thus wiping their copy of my gh-pages
        this sounds like either a bash script or i am doing this entirely wrong


    scripts/templates for quick scaffolding?

    make more examples i guess so that it will be possible to make scripts and/or templates

fork a [code of conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/), because i worry about the kinds of things that can be iframed in.
