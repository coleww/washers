# washers

A "washer" is an iframe centered in a browser window,

with a div absolutely positioned on top of it,

and some javascript or css or whatever stuff in that div.

### lol

"watchers" ... get it? i don't. it just came to me.

a watcher is just an html file. it depends on the internet,

but there are no other local dependencies besides having a web browser

### some examples:

    gco -b gh-pages
    # edit the index.html/readme.md to fill in yr deets or w/e
