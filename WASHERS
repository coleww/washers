WASHERS


Sometimes yr code is really dirty, which means u must "wash" it again and again and again
basically the workflow is to copy paste bits from w3schools until its no longer maintainable and then ship it to gh-pages


you watch them, and they spin around in cycles, and they cleanse you

and sometimes you interact with them
and sometimes u don't and they interact with you
